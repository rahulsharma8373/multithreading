/*
 * Thread Class vs Runnable Interface
 * If we extend the Thread class, our class cannot extend any other class
 * because Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance. But, if we implement the
 * Runnable interface, our class can still extend other base classes. We can
 * achieve basic functionality of a thread by extending Thread class because it
 * provides some inbuilt methods like yield(), interrupt() etc. that are not
 * available in Runnable interface. Using runnable will give you an object that
 * can be shared amongst multiple threads.
